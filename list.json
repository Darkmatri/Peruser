FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information. Such s- tems arebecoming increasinglyimportantalsodue to the huge andalwaysgr- ing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.",

    "description": "This book presents a systematic study of practices and theories for query understanding of search engines. These studies can be categorized into three major classes. The first class is to figure out what the searcher wants by extracting semantic meaning from the searcher’s keywords, such as query classification, query tagging, and query intent understanding. The second class is to analyze search queries and then translate them into an enhanced query that can produce better search results, such as query spelling correction or query rewriting. The third class is to assist users in refining or suggesting queries in order to reduce users’ search effort and satisfy their information needs, such as query auto-completion and query suggestion. Query understanding is a fundamental part of search engines. It is responsible to precisely infer the intent of the query formulated by the search user, to correct spelling errors in his/her query, to reformulate the query to capture its intent more accurately, and to guide the user in formulating a query with precise intent. The book will be invaluable to researchers and graduate students in computer or information science and specializing in information retrieval or web-based systems, as well as to researchers and programmers working on the development or improvement of products related to search engines.",

    "description": "Power Query for Power BI and Excel is a book for people who are tired of copying and pasting data into Excel worksheets. Power Query, part of the Microsoft Power BI suite, is a tool that automates the process of getting data into Excel and will save you hours of dull, repetitive, and error-prone work! Power Query makes it easy to extract data from many different data sources, filter that data, aggregate it, clean it and perform calculations on it, finally loading that data into either your worksheet or directly into the new Excel 2013 Data Model used by Power Pivot. This concise, practical book provides a complete guide to Power Query and how to use it to solve all of your Excel data-loading problems. Power Query for Power BI and Excel goes well beyond the surface of what Power Query can do. The book goes deep into the underlying M language, showing you how to do amazing things that aren’t going to be possible from just the GUI interface that is covered in most other books. You’ll have full command of the GUI, and you’ll be able to drop into the M language to go beyond what the GUI provides. The depth in this book makes it a must-have item for anyone who is pushing Power BI and Excel to their limits in the pursuit of business intelligence from data analysis. Teaches the basics of using Power Query to load data into Excel Helps you solve common, data-related problems with Power Query Shows how to write your own solutions in the powerful M language",

    "description": "There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration. Table of Contents: Introduction / Query Interface Representation and Extraction / Query Interface Clustering and Categorization / Query Interface Matching / Query Interface Attribute Integration / Query Interface Integration / Summary and Future Research",
